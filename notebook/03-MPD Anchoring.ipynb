    "# MPD Processing Notebook Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python notebook processes Mobile Positioning Data (MPD) to infer the anchoring location of each subscriber. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inferred results are used to measure the proxy indicator for `SDGs Indicator 17.8.1, which is the proportion of individuals using the Internet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initiate spark connection to access MPD filtered data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This step initiates a spark connection to access `MPD filtered data`. MPD is a dataset that contains information about the location of mobile devices at different times and can be used to analyze subscriber behavior and infer their home locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Summarization:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    The data is summarized into two sets of summary data: `User Summary` and `Cell Summary`. User Summary calculates user activity statistics such as the number of events/records, unique cell locations, unique days, principal technology used, and highest technology used. Each of these indicators is aggregated by different types of data sources, either from CDR or IPDR. On the other hand, Cell Summary categorizes the MPD into four distinct time periods called anchors: `early morning`, `morning`, `office hour`, and `night`. This categorization allows a better understanding and analysis of subscriber behavior based on different times of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Anchoring: Infer Home Candidate Location:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    The primary objective of this step is to infer the most probable cell tower associated with a `subscriber's home location`. This inference process relies on the data from the early morning class since it provides the highest likelihood of capturing the home location. However, if a direct inference cannot be made solely based on the early morning class, the system takes into account data from other time periods to enhance the accuracy of the inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Evaluation section is crucial for assessing the accuracy of home location inference. Metrics like `anchor label distribution` and `anchor cell ID distribution` help identify typical mobility patterns and spatial distribution of potential home locations. This data can be used to refine and optimize the inference process.\n"

    "\n",
    "The MPD data used in this notebook has already been filtered based on certain criteria in the previous step. This filtering ensures that the data is of high quality and relevant to the analysis being performed. Once the Spark connection is established, the notebook can proceed to the next step of summarizing the data.\n"

    "\n",
    "After loading the filtered MPD data into a Spark DataFrame, the next step is to summarize the data by subscriber ID. This involves grouping the data by subscriber ID and calculating various summary statistics, such as the total number of records per subscriber, the minimum and maximum timestamps, and the total duration of each subscriber's activity.\n",

We start by grouping the data by the `subscriber_id` column using the `groupBy()` method. We can then apply various aggregation functions to the grouped data using the `agg()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to calculate the total number of records per subscriber, we can use the `count()` aggregation function. To calculate the minimum and maximum timestamps, we can use the `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively. Finally, to calculate the total duration of each subscriber's activity, we can subtract the minimum timestamp from the maximum timestamp and convert the result to seconds.\n",

For example, subscribers with a very high number of records or a very long duration of activity may be exhibiting unusual behavior that warrants further investigation."

It renames the `cell_id` column to `anchor_cell_id`, creates an `anchor_label` column indicating that it is an indirect Anchor 1, and selects only the relevant columns (`msisdn`, `anchor_type`, `anchor_cell_id`, and `anchor_label`).\n",
